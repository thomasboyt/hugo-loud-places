I don't remember a lot about this show. I went because some Hacker School friends were going, but I'm not really a huge Anamanagchi fan - I like the whole chiptune thing, but they just don't do it for me. However, I do remember liking their show a lot because it just became a whirring blur of poppy synths at some point, and that was very easy to dance to. I also remember one of the openers having some of the weirdest projected visuals ever, freaky GIFs and strange YouTubes. Interesting night.
