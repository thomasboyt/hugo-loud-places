Patton! Wow. Probably the first comedian I ever really loved. I've listened to his specials so many times that I know a lot of his bits by heart. I actually got a *front row seat*, too, thanks to catching the Twitter presale right on time. 

This was a great show, a mix of stuff from his last special (which I think worked a lot better here, with a little more practice) and a lot of new jokes. In the encore, he ended up taking requests, and ended up doing some of my favorite bits. I also got to stand up and shake the dude's hand at the end, which was awesome. 

Also, Carnegie Hall is beautiful and I should try to go to more shows there.
