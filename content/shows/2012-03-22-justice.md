This was like the first actual concert I ever went to. It was cool. The Tabernacle is a super dope venue and I'd love to go back for another show sometime. I wish NYC had venues like that - Terminal 5 is sorta close, but their balcony isn't nearly as awesome. 

(update: after I originally wrote this entry, I went to my first show at Webster Hall, which is similarly pretty, but not nearly as awesome in general)
