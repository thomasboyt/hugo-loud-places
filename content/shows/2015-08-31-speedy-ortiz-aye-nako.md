This show was at a cool metal bar up in Greenpoint I'd been meaning to check out. Place ended up being great, even if it's a bit of a hike from the G (not nearly as long a walk as Baby's from the L, though).

I'd never been that impressed with Speedy Ortiz on record, but took a gamble on this show since it was $5, and they sound *so much better* live that I'm glad I did. Really dug their opener, Aye Nako, too.
