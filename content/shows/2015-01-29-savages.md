This was such a weird, incredible show, and maybe the best I've ever been to. It was weird, given that Savages went on at *1:15am* on a weeknight, as their show getting rescheduled due to a blizzard. It was even weirder for me because I was just regaining my hearing from seeing Viet Cong earlier, and now I was standing front-and-center for one of my favorite current bands. 

I was in the literal front row of a GA audience for, I think, the first time ever, and it made Savages seem ever-so-larger-than-life. Staring straight up into their frontwoman's face as she screamed over my head is an experience I'll never forget. I get goosebumps thinking about it now.
