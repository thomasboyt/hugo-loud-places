This was my first concert in NYC, and it was ridiculous and awesome. There were like three openers, and by the time Andrew came out on stage, he was plastered. He ended up playing an hour set of him banging on a keyboard while going in and out of "Party Hard." Totally awesome. I went with several cool people from Hacker School, some of whom I still hang out with today!
