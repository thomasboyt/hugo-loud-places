I was happy to finally see these guys play, having listened to their singles on repeat for the last two months. When their album dropped, I wasn't that impressed with it, but having heard it live, I actually liked it a lot more. It's interesting how the more raw rock/pop aspects of their music come into play when they're not hiding it behind the traditional post-rock lo-fi studio mixing. Really excited to see them again next time they're here.
