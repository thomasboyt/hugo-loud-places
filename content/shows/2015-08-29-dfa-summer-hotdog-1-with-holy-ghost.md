I don't really know how to do "clubs," so I bought a ticket to this with a bit of trepedation. It ended up being worth it - Good Room is a cool place, and their sound system is fantastic.

The secret live guest for this show was unannounced, and I was super happy to find out it was Holy Ghost!, one of the first bands I ever saw in NYC. Last time I saw them, it was at Terminal 5, and getting to see them in such an intimate setting was real treat. Their stage was set up *opposite* the front of the dance floor, where *James goddamn Murphy* had been DJing, so as soon as I realized they were setting up I pushed my way across the floor to get a good spot.

They didn't play anything new, which bummed me out a bit (it's been two years since their last record!), but they still sound great and have a killer live setup.
