Went to this on a whim because I live near the venue, and it was pretty good. My ears generally can't take hours of metal-volume music (really need to invest in some ear plugs), so the most memorable part of this show ended up being when I ducked out to the bar and ate some brussels sprouts during the second opener.

I know it might sound lame to have the most memorable moment of a concert being brussels sprouts, but y'all, they were *super good*.
