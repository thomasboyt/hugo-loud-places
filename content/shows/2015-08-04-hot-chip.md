I've loved Hot Chip for a really, really long time. "Ready For the Floor" was my ringtone for like a full year on my first cell phone. I was ecstatic to finally get to see them live.

Highlight was their encore, when they did a cover of Bruce Springsteen's "Dancing in the Dark" mixed with a verse from LCD Soundsystem's "All My Friends." I, uh, may have cried.
