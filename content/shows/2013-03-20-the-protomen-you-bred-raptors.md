I almost forgot I saw this show! It was cool. I hadn't really listened to their second album much by the time I saw this show, but walked away liking it a lot more than I did the first time I listened to it. Also, Bohemean Rhapsody was cool. 

YBR was a cool surprise; I still listen to their album on Spotify occasionally.
