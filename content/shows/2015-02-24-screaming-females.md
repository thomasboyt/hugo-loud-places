*Loud.* I heard about this band last week, and picked up their record this morning to get entry to this show. They played their new record in its entirety, and it was awesome. Somewhat low-key crowd, being an early show on a weeknight, but the band was as loud as I could stand in such a small room. Also bought a T-shirt from their bass player after the show.
