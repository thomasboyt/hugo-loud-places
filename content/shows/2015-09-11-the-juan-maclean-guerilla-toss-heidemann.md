Second time seeing The Juan MacLean this year, and, surprise surprise, I still love them. They played a bit of a weird set this time around, though. When I saw them at Cameo earlier this year, they were practicing playing their new record for the first time, and I remember them going through a lot of tracks (though unfortunately I can't find a setlist to confirm). This time around, they only played eight or nine tracks, which made the hour-long set feel far-too-short. Somewhat sad, unanswered chant of "one more song!" after the encore.

Fortunately, the openers made up for it. The first, HIEDEMANN, was worth getting to the venue early for. She has a fantastic voice, and while her set may have been pretty sparse (she performed solo, playing a few synths and a bass guitar), it was captivating.

Guerilla Toss is a *strange* punk group that I fell in love with immediately. Their lead singer reminds me a lot of Perfect Pussy's Meredith Graves. Their music, though, is far less noisy and far more danceable. [Their newest EP](https://guerillatoss.bandcamp.com/) is worth checking out, but I don't think it gets across their live sound very well. Their studio material is a lot more difficult to get into, I think, but live, they had no trouble getting people dancing. Hoping their upcoming LP (they just signed to DFA) captures them a bit better. In the meantime, I've already got tickets to see them headline next week at Shea.
