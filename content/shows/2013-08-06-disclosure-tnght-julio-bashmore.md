WOOOOOW what a show this was. I think the bill mostly speaks for itself; I'm not sure I'll ever see a better lineup in one night. The place went insane when TNGHT dropped Blood on the Leaves, as it had *just* come out. 

Disclosure was great, and had both Sam Smith (pre-fame) and Jesse Ware. I ended up hanging out with a group of very high dudes for a while, and harmonized on Latch at the end of the show with them :3
