The most ridiculous part of this - and there were many ridiculous parts, because *TNA* - was that when I took my initial seat, I posted a picture of it on a forum saying that it was what was available for $20. Turns out, there was a guy sitting behind me who also posted on this forum, and saw my post, and so we ended up hanging out for the whole show! He knew a lot more about the TNA roster than I did, so that worked out well for me. We also ended up getting moved to really good seats that were probably $50-60 online. Thank god TNA is such an unpopular promotion.

I legitimately enjoyed this. It was cool seeing wrestlers I hadn't seen before (Samoa Joe, Austin Aries, Bobby Roode, Eric Young) and some I haven't seen since (Low Ki, Kurt Angle, the Hardys), and I ended up marking out for things that I would probably make fun of if I saw them on TV.
