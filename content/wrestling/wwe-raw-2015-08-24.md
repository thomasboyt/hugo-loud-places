I hadn't planned on going to this, but between a better-than-expected SummerSlam and my last chance for a while to see main-roster WWE live, plus it being my birthday, I splurged on a decent lower bowl ticket. I was happy to find I had an aisle seat next to the exit, meaning I could easily duck out for more $12(!) beers during Raw's many commercial breaks.

This was a far better show than I expected from Raw, other than a really depressing-to-watch Divas match with zero heat (especially after the solid-to-amazing women's matches at TakeOver). Seeing The New Day come out with Xavier Woods on a trombone, John Cena AA Jon Stewart, and STING OUT OF NOWHERE made this more than worth it.
